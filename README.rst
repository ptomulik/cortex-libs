cortex-libs
===========

A skeleton used to compile-test libraries for ARM cortex microcontrollers. 

Overview
--------

The actual code that gets compiled is held as separate git-based projects,
which are "attached" to this framework as git submodules. Here we have just a
single ``SConstruct`` script which triggers compilation of all the submodules
by calling their ``SConscripts``. 

Getting Started
---------------

Three steps are necessary to bootstrap complete source tree:

#. Clone this repository::

      git clone git@github.com:ptomulik/cortex-libs.git
      cd cortex-libs

#. Initialize submodules::
      
      git submodule init

#. Update submodules::

      git submodule update

Compiling
---------

Just type::

    scons

All the stuff goes to ``build`` directory.

What gets built
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently we build the following stuff:

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|      Module           |                       Info                       |
+=======================+==================================================+
| ST/StdPeriph          | The following targets are built:                 |
